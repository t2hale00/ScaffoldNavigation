# Implementing Navigation with Scaffold in Android Studio (Kotlin)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to implement navigation within an Android app using the `Scaffold` widget in Android Studio with Kotlin. The `Scaffold` widget is a key component in Material Design that provides a layout structure for the top-level navigation elements such as the app bar and drawer.

## Features

- Shows basic usage of the `Scaffold` widget for navigation.
- Includes navigation between different screens using the Navigation Component.
- Illustrates the use of `AppBar` for top-level navigation.
- Implements a side drawer for additional navigation options.

## Requirements

- Android Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Basic understanding of Android app development with Kotlin.
- (Optional) Android device or emulator to run the app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/t2hale00/ScaffoldNavigation.git
    ```

2. Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project".

3. Navigate to the project directory and select the root folder of the cloned repository.

4. Build and run the app on a device or emulator.

## Usage

- Explore the `app/src/main` directory to understand the structure of the app.
- Modify the code in Kotlin files (`*.kt`) and XML layout files (`*.xml`) to customize navigation behavior according to your requirements.
- Refer to the comments in the code for guidance on how navigation is implemented using `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `Drawer`.
